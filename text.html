  <h1>File management using the command line </h1>
  <p>You can browse and manage files using the command line just as in the graphical environment. Let’s compare managing files using a graphical and a text user interface.</p>

  <p>Open the graphical file browser. In ubuntu, open the application called “Files”, or write the command nautilus and press <code>ENTER</code>. In Windows write explorer.exe instead. In MacOS, open finder and press the keys <code>Shift + Cmd + H.</code></p>

  <p>You should now be in your home folder. The home folder holds all the personal files and folders of a user. If you are using one of the department’s computers, the contents of your home folders are the same regardless of which physical computer you are using. This is because the contents are fetched from elsewhere. If you are using your personal computer, the home folder only includes the files on that physical computer.</p>

  <p>If using Windows Subsystem for Linux (or Ubuntu application), note that your Linux home is different than Windows home. If you need to access files or folders in your Windows home navigate to /mnt/c/Users/username (using cd /mnt/c/Users/username). Also note that most of the time directory ~ will refer to your Linux home</p>
  <p>Note that if you opened the graphical file browser using the command line, the shell is “locked”, and you can’t run any other commands using that window. You can close the currently running program by pressing <code>CTRL + C</code>. You can press the keys repeatedly if necessary.</p>
